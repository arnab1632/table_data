# Table Data
In this task, user can insert any user's information. If any user press the 'Add User' button of index page, a pop-up will show. User can upload user information. After adding any user information, all data will show in a table. If anyone want to add more data, he/she can do it. User can edit user information. If anyone select 'Action' column black 'Edit' icon, a pop-up will show data of that user. Anyone can delete that user information. If anyone select 'Action' column red 'Delete' icon, a confirm message will show that do you want to delete the user information. If anyone click 'yes', that information will delete. If anyone click 'cancel', that information will not delete. 
Thank you.
